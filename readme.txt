File includes:
main.py and webCrawler.py are the codes.
result.txt and tf_matrix.csv are the results, they are generated by my last run.
You can run the program to rewrite these two files.

Enviroment:
I use Python 3.6 for my program. I think it can be run by any Python 3.x.

Need some packages to run my program. There are:
requests
re
bs4
hashlib
string
nltk.stem
http
prettytable

How to run:
Just run the main.py, it will link the webCrawler automaticlly (I hope).

Output:
there are two output files.
result.txt contains all the results which are used in my report.
tf_matrix.csv is the term-document frequency matrix which is the answer to the question 6, d part.
